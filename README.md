# MSDS460 Baseball Analytics

This project uses baseball game data from the Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox to simulate outcomes of head-to-head matchups.

Three Monte Carlo simulation models were created using different levels of data granularity.
1. Win Percentage Data
2. Season Player Data
3. Head-to-Head Player Data

This data comes from a combination of the PyBaseball library and baseballreference.com.
